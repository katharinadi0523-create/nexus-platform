# Project Context
This is the Nexus Platform, a comprehensive AI development platform built with Next.js 14+, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI.
The goal is to build an agent development platform similar to Coze/Dify.

# User Role
I am a Technical Product Manager (Ruonan). I focus on:
1. High-level architecture and product logic.
2. PRD-level requirements (Features, User Flows).
3. "Vibe Coding" - I describe the intent, you write the code.

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Lucide React.
- State Management: React Hooks, Context API.

# Coding Rules
- Always use TypeScript interfaces.
- Component-based architecture.
- When creating UI, ensure it looks modern, clean, and enterprise-grade (B-end style).
- Before writing complex logic, explain the plan step-by-step.
